## Tech Breakdown

-   **PHP:** Vibely leveraged PHP as its server-side scripting language, powering the backend logic and server functionalities to handle dynamic content and database interactions.

-   **JavaScript and Vue.js:** The frontend of Vibely was enriched with dynamic and responsive features through JavaScript, with Vue.js playing a key role in creating interactive user interfaces and handling client-side data.

-   **Laravel:** As the PHP web application framework, Laravel facilitated the rapid development of Vibely by providing a robust, expressive syntax and a variety of tools for tasks like routing, authentication, and database management.

-   **Inertia:** Inertia.js was used to seamlessly link Laravel on the backend with Vue.js on the frontend, enabling a single-page application experience without sacrificing the benefits of a traditional server-driven architecture.

-   **Jetstream:** Laravel Jetstream provided a pre-built application scaffolding, accelerating the development process by offering authentication, teams, and API support, along with the benefits of Laravel's ecosystem.

-   **Tailwind CSS:** Vibely adopted Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling, streamlining the design process and ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface across the platform.

-   **AWS S3:** Amazon S3, a scalable object storage service, was integrated into Vibely to efficiently manage and store static assets, ensuring reliable and secure content delivery.
